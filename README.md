# twitter-bot
This bot fetches posts from my Tumblr account using Tumblr’s API, and then takes this media and on a scheduled timer, posts the corresponding post on a Twitter account. Backend API calls, etc. done in node.js, Front end UI written with HTML5 and CSS3, and perhaps using the React Javascript Framework at a later date. Running on a website hosted by GitHub.
